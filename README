Which features did you implement? 
  Entire Assignment

Did you complete any extra-credit tasks? If so, which ones?
  No

Any special instructions for building and running your solution?
  - Note: I wrote a test script called verify.sh to test my solution
    - Usage:
      /* clear database if it exists */      
      rm -rf database 
      /* run web server (with default params, will work)*/
      mvn exec:java@web
      /* in separate terminal */
      ./verify.sh        <--- registers user with username admin and password pass, 
                              creates many channels for testing,
                              does all this through assignment API as if you did it 
                              on your browser, but using cURL
      < stop web server (e.g. by pressing enter in terminal) >
      /* run crawler (1 or more times) */
      mvn exec:java@crawler
      < wait for crawler to finish or stop it early by pressing enter > 
      /* run web server */
      mvn exec:java@web
      < manually browse around logging in as (admin, pass), to see what documents matched >
      < if there are no matches to Middle East for example, try running crawler more than once>
